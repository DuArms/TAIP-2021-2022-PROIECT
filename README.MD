# Description
Some documents or photos are confidential. If we upload these documents to the cloud, GDPR reasons may occur even if they are stored securely. A potential solution to this problem would be to obscure these images and documents with a set of randomly generated steps that would alter their content until the owner wants to access them again.
Example: for photos we can apply N layers above it in a random order with visual operations such as changing the contrast, adding effects (blur, pixelate the image), changing various properties, etc. These operations will be retained in order to be able to retrieve the content once the user wants it again. In addition to these operations, various mechanisms for verifying the validity of document integrity can be implemented, such as a signature of the original content and its verification after de-obfuscation.
